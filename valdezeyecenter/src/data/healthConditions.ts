    name: "Amblyopia (Lazy Eye)",
    description: "Amblyopia, commonly referred to as lazy eye, is a condition where one eye has weaker vision than the other due to inadequate visual stimulation during childhood. This can occur due to factors such as crossed eyes or significant differences in refractive errors between the two eyes. If left untreated, amblyopia can lead to permanent vision impairment in the weaker eye. Early intervention, often involving corrective eyewear and visual therapy, can help stimulate proper visual development and improve the weaker eye's function.",

    name: "Astigmatism",
    description: "Astigmatism is a common refractive error that results from an uneven curvature of the cornea or lens. This causes light to focus unevenly on the retina, leading to blurred or distorted vision. Astigmatism can occur alongside nearsightedness or farsightedness and is corrected with eyeglasses, contact lenses, or refractive surgery.",

    name: "Cataracts",
    description: "Cataracts involve the clouding of the eye's natural lens, which is normally clear and allows light to enter the eye. This clouding causes blurred vision, decreased visual clarity, and increased sensitivity to glare. Cataracts are a common age-related condition, but they can also develop as a result of factors such as injury, certain medications, or medical conditions. Cataract surgery, where the cloudy lens is replaced with an artificial lens, is a highly effective treatment option that can restore clear vision.",

    name: "Color Blindness",
    description: "Color blindness, also known as color vision deficiency, is a genetic condition that affects an individual's ability to perceive certain colors accurately. This condition is more common in males due to the way the genes responsible for color vision are inherited. Most cases of color blindness result from the absence or dysfunction of specific color-sensing pigments in the retina. While there is no cure for color blindness, individuals with this condition can learn to adapt to their visual environment using strategies like color-coding and pattern recognition.",
