## Overview

This project involved the creation of a tailored web application for an eye clinic, with a focus on showcasing its location, staff, services, mission, and contact options. The primary objective was to not only meet the clinic's specifications but also exceed their expectations. The application was built using cutting-edge technologies including TypeScript, React, and Next.js.
